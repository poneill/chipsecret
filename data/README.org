This directory contains data sources that should be considered "raw
inputs" to the project.  A data source is a raw input if it originated
outside of the project, or was generated from a raw input using a
program written outside of the project with default parameters.  If a
data source was compiled using code written for the project, or an
external program with custom parameter settings, it belongs in the
=results= directory, even if the data source contains the output of an
intermediate computation rather than a final result.
